SUBQUERY
Allows us to construct complex queries, essentially performing a query on the results of another query.
EXISTS() to check if any rows are returned with the subquery
Select col FROM table wHERE EXISTS (SELECT col FROM table WHERE condition)

SELECT title,rental_rate
FROM film
WHERE rental_rate > (SELECT AVG(rental_rate) FROM film)



SELECT film_id,title
FROM film
WHERE film_id IN
(SELECT inventory.film_id 
FROM rental
INNER JOIN inventory ON inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
WHERE return_date BETWEEN '2005-05-29' AND '2005-05-30')
ORDER BY film_id

Customer made one payment more than 11 dollars
SELECT first_name,last_name
FROM customer AS c
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT * FROM payment as p
WHERE p.customer_id = c.customer_id
AND amount>11)
SELF JOIN()

A query in which table is joined to itself
2 copies of same table
Should use an alias when using self join

SELECT f1.title,f2.title,f1.length 
FROM film AS f1
INNER JOIN film AS f2 ON
f1.film_id != f2.film_id
AND f1.length = f2.length
